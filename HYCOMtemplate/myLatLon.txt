# The idea is to put lat and lon in one place, then have the bash
# scripts refer to this file. 
# NOTE: The grid file has to be one data point larger in all 4 directions.
# The HYCOM data is .08 deg intervals so you have to add/subtract .08
# from the lat/lon in this file.


latMin=4
latMax=11
lonMin=120
