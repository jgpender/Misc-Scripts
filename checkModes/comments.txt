It is becoming more and more clear that using a single reference set of
N2(z) and rho(z) to calculate the modes for an entire experiment is a bad
idea.

1) I noticed some time ago that if the modes are clamped at any
particular value then the eigencoefficients are not allowed the time
deviation they're entitled to. The longer the experiment runs the worse
this problem gets.

2) I have just now gone through the business of calculating the 
displacement. If rho(z) is not so different from the reference
stratification rho0(z) then the general experession for D (already
assuming rho0(z) can be pulled out of the integral)
	rho(z) - rho0(z) = rho0/g Integral[_z ^zNew N20(z) dz]
where 
	D = zNew-z

can be simplified. Specifically, if zNew-z is small then N20(z) is nearly
constant so you can write
	D = zNew-z
	  ~ g/rho0(z) (rho - rho0) / N20(z)

The thing is, D at shallow depths (<200 m) is very often high by a good 
factor of 3 or 4. This bugs me, but the eigencoefficent calculation is
weighted by dz, which is small for these very depths, so maybe I should 
just shut up. Or use small t. Or deploy my find-the-mode scheme.
